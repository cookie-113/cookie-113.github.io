    <h1>Toys 'R' Us Makes a Holiday Comeback</h1>
    <h3>Pop-Up Stores Set to Bring Holiday Cheer to the Philadelphia Area</h3>

    <p>The classic toy retailer <strong>Toys 'R' Us</strong> is returning to the spotlight this holiday season. 
        The company is launching new stores across the country, including two <em>pop-up locations</em> in the Philadelphia region. 
        These temporary shops aim to capture the excitement of toy shopping just in time for the festive rush.
    </p>

    <p>Each pop-up will feature favorite brands such as <b>LEGO</b>, <b>Barbie</b>, and <b>Hot Wheels</b>. 
        Families will have a chance to browse shelves filled with some of the year’s most popular gifts, 
        all under one roof designed to recreate the magic of the original toy stores.
    </p>

    <p>
        One pop-up will open at the <cite>Deptford Mall</cite> in New Jersey, while another will appear at the 
        <cite>King of Prussia Mall</cite> in Pennsylvania. Both stores are expected to open in early November, 
        giving shoppers plenty of time to prepare for the holidays and rediscover what it means to be a “Toys 'R' Us kid.”
